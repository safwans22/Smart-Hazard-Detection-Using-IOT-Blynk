#Smart Hazard Detection Using Iot Blynk

Smart Hazard Detection System implements Internet Of Things in detetecting any unsual activity around its environment. It detects for gas leakage, temperature increaes and monitors water levels by employing respective sensors. A notification is sent to the user through Blynk. Also, Actuators have been installed to stall any futher hazardous situation.

1.	Problem Statement

The challenge of ensuring safety in diverse environments is multifaceted. Traditional hazard detection systems often lack the scalability, responsiveness, and affordability required to meet the evolving needs of modern society. Furthermore, existing solutions may not adequately address the full spectrum of potential hazards, leaving gaps in safety protocols that could have serious consequences. Our project seeks to bridge these gaps by offering a comprehensive and versatile solution that can effectively detect and prevent a wide range of hazards in real-time.

2.	Objective

The primary objective of our project is to design and implement an effective Hazard Detection & Prevention System that leverages IoT technologies to detect various hazards such as gas leaks, fires, and environmental changes in real-time. Our aim is to develop a system that is not only reliable and accurate but also accessible and cost-effective, thus empowering individuals and organizations to enhance safety measures in their respective environments.

## Cloud Setup
1. Blynk files for different sensor connections ahve been attached in the repo.
2. You need to create a template in the blynk and add the Meter for temperature and humidity
3. Also, for gas detection and water level, you need a template and add the notifications to it.
4. For further clarifications regarding Blynk, refer to internet.
